            <p>We all have a different ways in which we see and interpret the world. Whilst some prefer to look at the ‘big picture’, others prefer a more detailed approach. Whilst some prefer concepts and ideas, others prefer facts, figures and objective analysis. These preferences are neither right nor wrong, but simply different, yet they hold significant implications for your investment decision-making and subsequent long-term wealth creation. The field of Investment Psychology is the science of understanding the relationship between your thinking and your investment decision-making and subsequent wealth creation.</p>

            <p>These thinking preferences are unconscious, habitual, automatic, and therefore make you prone to ‘unconscious bias’: a leaning towards buying or selling certain investments without ‘rhyme nor reason’. At the heart of making good investment decisions is an inner struggle between your ‘rational’ logical mind and your ‘emotional’ intuitive mind. Your Investor DNA profile helps you be consciously aware of your own natural inner biases, investment predispositions and thinking preferences, helping you make better investment decisions over time.</p>

            <p>Your Investor DNA profile provides you with self-insight into your own Investment Psychology. This includes your decision-making style, risk appetite and preferred asset classes, innate biases and preferred communication style.  It also identifies key factors that influence the level of trust between you and your adviser. Investor DNA helps your adviser provide a tailored investment solution, whilst helping you make better investment decisions over time. It is worth considering that your financial net worth today is the sum of all of your financial decisions made up until this point in time. It makes intuitive sense then, that by improving your investment decision-making you will increase your net wealth over time, safeguarding your lifestyle today and in the future.</p>
